<h2>NIST Encounter tracing programs for testing</h2>

<h3> This website is hosted on github and contains links to html code to communicate with NIST bluetooth devices being used for exposure/encounter tracing</h3>
<h3> The link below that communicate only works in Google Chrome Browsers on computers and Android devices. We are working on a app for iOS and Androids for more complete control on those platforms</h3>
<a class="button" href="nistet/nist-et-v1.html">Control bluetooth device</a>

<h3> After "fetch"ing data to your computer from the bluetooth device, use the link below to translate it into multiple CSV files for inspection and submission as data for the study.</h3>
